Seven US personnel were injured when two rockets hit Al Asad Airbase in Iraq on Monday, a defense official said on Tuesday.

“Five US servicemembers and two US contractors were injured in the attack. Five injured personnel are receiving care at Al Asad Airbase and two have been evacuated for further care,” the official said. “All seven injured personnel are in stable condition.”

The official said post-strike assessments are still ongoing.

The US Defense Department late Monday blamed Iran-aligned militia groups for the attack, calling it a “dangerous escalation.”

A Pentagon readout of a call between US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said the two men “agreed that today’s Iran-aligned militia attack on U.S. forces stationed at Al-Asad Airbase in western Iraq marked a dangerous escalation and demonstrated Iran’s destabilizing role in the region.”

Austin reiterated to Gallant “unwavering U.S. commitment to Israel’s security in the face of threats from Iran, Lebanese Hizballah, and other Iran-aligned militia groups,” according to the readout.

A vehicle carrying rockets was intercepted by the Iraqi military Monday after the attack. The Iraqi military said in a statement that two rockets were launched from the vehicle in the Haditha district, with eight more being prepared for launch.

The statement added that the perpetrators of the attack are currently being pursued and that leaders, commanders and officers responsible for the “security breaches in the area” will be held accountable.

The attack comes amid extremely high tensions in the Middle East, as the US has been bracing for Iranian retaliation against Israel over the assassination of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran last week. Israel has not commented on the killing of Haniyeh. Hezbollah in Lebanon has also vowed retaliation on Israel after the assassination of one of its top commanders in Beirut less than a day before Haniyeh’s killing.

It also comes just days after Austin ordered additional military assets to the region, sending a carrier strike group, a fighter squadron and additional warships to the Middle East.

US officials have long blamed attacks on troops in Iraq and Syria on Iran-backed militia groups.

Deputy Pentagon press secretary Sabrina Singh said last month after a drone attack on Al-Asad that it was “most likely” carried out by Iranian-supported groups.

“We know that these are IRGC-backed militias that have launched these attacks on US forces in the past. Most likely than not, it is one of those affiliate groups,” Singh said on July 18.

Between October 17 and January 29, there were more than 150 attacks on US personnel in Iraq and Syria. Those attacks slowed after three American troops were killed in a drone attack on a small US outpost in Jordan, resulting in a significant US response that hit 85 targets at seven different locations.

“The United States does not seek conflict in the Middle East or anywhere else in the world,” President Joe Biden said at the time. “But let all those who might seek to do us harm know this: If you harm an American, we will respond.”
