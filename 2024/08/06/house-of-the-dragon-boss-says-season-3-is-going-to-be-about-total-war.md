The Season 2 finale of “House of the Dragon” that aired Sunday night kept on teasing a big battle scene. You know, the kind of signature “Game of Thrones”-style battle where Kings and Queens try to take what they believe is rightfully theirs, complete with dragonfire and pithy lines about why such bloodshed is necessary?

Well, we’ll have to wait a little longer to see that.

The “Thrones” prequel series opted for an overture to what will be some major action in Season 3, according to showrunner Ryan Condal.

“While this season was very much about the fits and starts of an early medieval war, season three is clearly going to be about total war,” Condal said in the post-episode featurette.

A large part of setting up the forthcoming battle was Daemon’s (Matt Smith) arc this season, which culminated with him finally picking a side and bending the knee to Rhaenyra (Emma D’Arcy).

Daemon had been haunted by visions of his past that forced him to reckon with his future while he was at Harrenhal procuring a Riverlands army. His decision to go with Team Black was based on one revelatory vision that Alys Rivers (Gayle Rankin) declared he was finally ready to see. In it viewers were treated to familiar scenes from “Game of Thrones,” including haunting images of the Night King and the White Walkers, the Three-Eyed Raven, dead dragons, Daemon’s own death and the future Danaerys Targaryen (Emilia Clarke) and her three baby dragons rising up from the ashes.

Daemon basically saw all eight seasons of “GOT” in sixty seconds.

He also saw Rhaenyra on the Iron Throne as his brother King Viserys (Paddy Considine) had wanted, cementing his decision to swear fealty to her. He realized then that he’s just a small part of a bigger story in Westeros, one that he cannot control but knows now that Rhaneyra is meant to lead.

When they finally reunited at Harrenhal, he told her about his vision and uttered that all-too-familiar “Thrones” warning: “Winter is coming.”

### Also in the finale…

Cheers to another season of fiery and complicated family dynamics.
