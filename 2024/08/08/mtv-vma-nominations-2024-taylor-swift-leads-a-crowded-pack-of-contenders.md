The nominations for MTV’s Video Music Awards (VMAs) were announced on Tuesday, and Taylor Swift leads among nominees.

Swift garnered ten nominations, mostly for her whimsical black-and-white music video for the lead single “Fortnight” off her album “The Tortured Poets Department.”

Her featured artist on that track, Post Malone, followed closely behind with nine nods.

Song of summer “Espresso” singer Sabrina Carpenter, along with Eminem and Ariana Grande, each received six nominations, while SZA and Megan Thee Stallion nabbed five apiece.

Other artists to receive multiple nominations include Olivia Rodrigo, Blackpink’s Lisa, Anitta, Dua Lipa, Tyla and GloRilla.

The VMAs will air live from UBS Arena in Elmont, New York on September 10 at 8 pm ET/PT.
