Connie Chiume, the veteran South African actress who starred in the 2018 Marvel movie “Black Panther,” has died aged 72.

Her family confirmed her death at a Johannesburg hospital in a short statement published on social media.

In a brief announcement on Instagram on Tuesday, they said: “The Chiume family regrets to inform you of the passing of the International Acclaimed award winning actress Connie Chiume.

“Connie Chiume 72, passed on at Garden City Hospital today on the 6th August 2024. The family asks for privacy during this difficult period. The family will communicate further details.”

Chiume, who played tribal leader Zawavari in both “Black Panther” and its 2022 sequel, “Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,” was a household name in her native South Africa.
