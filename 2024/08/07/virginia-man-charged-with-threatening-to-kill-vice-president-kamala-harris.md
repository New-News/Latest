A Virginia man has been charged with making death threats against Vice President Kamala Harris and appeared in federal court on Monday.

According to court records, Frank Lucio Carillo made several threats against Harris, President Joe Biden, FBI Director Christopher Wray, several Arizona officials, and others on the right-wing social media platform Gettr.

In response to a subpoena, the FBI found 4,359 posts from Carillo “targeting various public officials,” including Harris.

In several posts, Carillo allegedly threatened to cut out Harris’ eyes and described various ways he wanted to kill the vice president, court records say.

“I will cut your eyes out,” Carillo allegedly wrote in one expletive-laden rant where he called Harris a “b*tch” and said he hoped she would “suffer a slow agonizing death.”

A number of similar posts are cited in court records, with graphic and detailed threats against the vice president as well as others, including one Islamophobic post in 2023 when he wrote that people should “go out with your guns and kill all Muslims.”

When FBI agents first arrived at Carillo’s house over the social media posts, Carillo asked if they were there “about the online stuff,” and said, “I posted it.” Carrillo, appearing to talk to himself, also said, “I guess I’m gonna need a lawyer,” according to court documents.

Federal agents retrieved two firearms from his home, including a pistol he bought in 2023 and a rifle purchased this year.

A hearing to determine whether Carillo will remain behind bars while awaiting a resolution in his case has been set for Thursday.

CNN is reaching out to an attorney for Carillo for comment.
