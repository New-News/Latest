A number of athletes have praised the special atmosphere created by thousands of fans at this year’s Olympics, but few venues can compete with Paris’ La Défense Arena, which hosted the swimming events.

Katie Ledecky helped create some of those magical moments with her brilliant performances in the pool, where she won four medals – two gold, one silver and one bronze.

Her success also saw her became the most decorated female US Olympian of all time.

Speaking to CNN Sport’s Coy Wire, Ledecky said the atmosphere in Paris was made all the more impressive considering the lack of crowds in Tokyo three years ago due to Covid-19 restrictions.

“The energy here in Paris has been incredible,” she said.

“It’s great to have family and friends back at the Olympics after not being there in Tokyo. It’s just been a great environment, a great atmosphere. “It’s very special to share the moments after competition with all them, get to celebrate and soak in a little bit of Paris.”
