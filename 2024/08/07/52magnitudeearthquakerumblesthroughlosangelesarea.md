A 5.2-magnitude earthquake struck near Lamont, California, on  Tuesday night and rumbled through a broad stretch of Southern California, including Los Angeles.

The US Geological Survey reported the earthquake’s epicenter hit about 15 miles southwest of Lamont – and roughly 25 miles south of Bakersfield – around 9:09 p.m. PT. The center earlier rated the earthquake a 5.3 magnitude but later downgraded it to 5.2.

At least 30 smaller quakes – ranging in magnitude from 2.5 to 4.5 – were recorded in the area over the next hour, according to the US Geological Survey.

About 100 miles southeast, the Los Angeles Fire Department launched into earthquake mode, sending people from all 106 of its citywide fire stations out to survey whether the area was impacted.

During the process, which usually takes less than an hour, fire crews will “conduct a strategic survey by land, air and sea of their districts, examining critical infrastructure and areas of local concern,” the agency said.

No reports of structural damage or injuries were immediately made in Los Angeles, the fire department said.

The US Geological Survey indicated the main quake presented a low likelihood of casualties or damage, giving it a “green” alert in its PAGER system, which provides fatality and economic loss estimates.

This is a developing story and will be updated.
