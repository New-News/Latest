A 5.3 magnitude earthquake struck near Bakersfield, California Tuesday night, according to the US Geological Survey.

The earthquake could be felt across Southern California, including in Los Angeles.

The Los Angeles Fire Department said it has gone into earthquake mode.

More than 100 neighborhood fire stations across Los Angeles will “conduct a strategic survey by land, air and sea of their districts, examining critical infrastructure and areas of local concern across our 470 square mile City of Los Angeles jurisdiction,” the agency said in an advisory. The process usually takes less than an hour, the department said.

There have been no reports of structural damage or injuries in Los Angeles so far, Los Angeles fire officials said.

This is a developing story and will be updated.
