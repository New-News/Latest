The Metropolitan Police Department said it arrested a Texas woman who traveled to Washington, DC, for allegedly making threats against former President Donald Trump and carrying a gun without a license.

Police were first alerted to woman Friday afternoon by the US Secret Service, according to a police report obtained by CNN.

Officers found the woman and her Honda Accord in a residential area in northeastern DC, according to the report and a police news release.

Police said they charged 41-year-old Christina Montoya of San Antonio, Texas, with carrying a pistol without a license, possession of an unregistered firearm and making threats against a former president. Montoya was in custody Friday night, according to the news release.

The police report indicates the threats against Trump started on July 20. Police did not provide any specifics about the alleged threats.
