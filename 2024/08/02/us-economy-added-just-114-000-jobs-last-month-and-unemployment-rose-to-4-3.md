The US labor market cooled off far more than expected last month, underscoring concerns that the economy has slowed down too quickly and could end up in a recession.

Businesses added just 114,000 jobs in July, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data released Friday and the unemployment rate unexpectedly leapt to 4.3%, which is the highest since October 2021.

That’s a significantly lower total than the 175,000 that economists were expecting. The unemployment rate was forecast to remain at 4.1%.

The surprisingly weak July jobs report — which also showed that both May’s and June’s estimated gains were revised lower — increases fears that the labor market is not cooling gradually to pre-pandemic levels but possibly weakening outright.

Taken on its own, this is a “treading water” jobs report, Ernie Tedeschi, the former chief economist at the White House Council of Economic Advisors who now serves as Yale Budget Lab’s director of economics, told CNN.

“We’re in an economy where a 100,000-per-month jobs report could mean a good thing, or it could mean a bad thing,” he said. “We could be talking about an economy that is at full employment that is just settling into a long-run equilibrium, and that is a good thing; that’s the goal.”

“On the other hand, we could be talking about a labor market that is deteriorating, one where policymakers should be acting more concretely to intervene to help,” he added.

Still, Tedeschi cautioned to not rely too heavily on one month’s worth of data: During the past three months, job gains are averaging 170,000.

Friday’s report also is raising questions of the Federal Reserve, which has become more attuned to potential weakness in the labor market, but opted to hold interest rates steady on Wednesday. These latest numbers now cast doubt as to whether the jobs market has enough gas in the tank left to stay on cruise control until and after the first cut is made (as monetary policy acts with a lag).

The first interest rate cut is all-but-certain to occur in September.

“Oh dear, has the Fed made a policy mistake?” Seema Shah, chief global strategist for Principal Asset Management, wrote Friday in commentary. “The labor market’s slowdown is now materializing with more clarity. Job gains have dropped below the 150,000 threshold that would be considered consistent with a solid economy.”

The health care and social assistance industry continued to lead the job growth last month — accounting for more than half of the monthly gains by adding 64,000 jobs. Construction (+25,000), leisure and hospitality (+23,000), and government (+17,000), saw the next-highest gains; however, job creation across other industries was languid.

While the US labor market remains in a historic period of expansion — July marks the 43rd consecutive month of job growth, the fifth-longest on record — much of the gains seen in the past two years have not been broad-based, heightening concerns among labor economists.
