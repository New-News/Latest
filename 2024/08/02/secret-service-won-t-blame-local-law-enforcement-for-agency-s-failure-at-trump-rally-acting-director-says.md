Acting US Secret Service Director Ronald Rowe said Friday that local police forces should not be blamed for the security failures that led to last month’s attempted assassination of Donald Trump.

“In no way should any state or local agency supporting us in Butler on July 13th be held responsible for our Secret Service failure,” Rowe told reporters Friday.

“Every single person within the Secret Service feels the weight of what happened” at Trump’s July 13 rally, he added.

“We will earn back your trust,” Rowe said.
