D’Vontaye Mitchell, the 43-year-old man who was pinned to the ground in June by security officers outside a Hyatt Regency hotel in Milwaukee, died from “restraint asphyxia and toxic effects of cocaine and methamphetamine,” according to an autopsy report released Friday by the Milwaukee County Medical Examiner’s office.

The manner of death is homicide, the report states.

CNN has reached out to the Milwaukee County District Attorney’s Office for comment about whether it will pursue criminal charges in the case.

Mitchell died June 30 after he was pinned down by hotel security guards in an incident partially captured on video. Hotel employees have been fired since the incident, and police have referred four charges of felony murder in Mitchell’s death, Milwaukee police said in a statement to CNN at the time. A homicide investigation is ongoing.

“This 43-year-old male was restrained by four people after being combative in the hotel lobby,” an investigation report from the medical examiner’s office states. “He reportedly went unresponsive while staff awaited police arrival. Illicit drug paraphernalia was found on his person. The decedent was conveyed to this office for an autopsy.”

The encounter unfolded as the use of force – particularly against people of color – by police and others in authority roles remains under scrutiny nearly four years after protests flared nationwide following the murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer.

CNN’s Alisha Ebrahimji contributed to this report.
