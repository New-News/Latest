Donald Trump’s campaign said Thursday that its political operation raised $138.7 million in July for the former president’s election effort – and amassed $327 million in cash reserves for the roughly three-month sprint to the election.

Trump’s total represents a jump from June when the former president’s campaign and aligned committees reported bringing in nearly $112 million, but the July total is expected to be dwarfed by the fundraising haul of his newly minted Democratic rival, Vice President Kamala Harris.

Her campaign and affiliated committees have not yet released full July fundraising numbers, but her campaign has said it collected an eye-popping $200 million in roughly the first week of her candidacy and signed up 170,000 new volunteers. President Joe Biden ended his reelection bid on July 21 and endorsed Harris – reshaping the race for the White House just as it heads into its final stretch.

In a short statement, the Trump campaign said that the total reflected “continued momentum with donors” and that the large stockpile of campaign dollars ensures Trump would have the resources to prevail on Election Day.

Presidential campaigns will file the full details of their July fundraising and spending later this month.
