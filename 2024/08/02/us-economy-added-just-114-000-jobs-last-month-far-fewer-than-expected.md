The US labor market cooled off far more than expected last month, underscoring concerns that the economy has slowed down too quickly and could lead to a recession.

Businesses added just 114,000 jobs in July, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data released Friday and the unemployment rate unexpectedly leapt to 4.3%, which is the highest since October 2021.

Economists were expecting employers to have added 175,000 jobs and for the unemployment rate to remain at 4.1%.

The unexpectedly weak July jobs report — which also showed that both May’s and June’s estimated gains were revised lower — raises fears that the labor market is not cooling gradually to pre-pandemic levels but outright weakening.

This story is developing and will be updated.
