The man who stole a bronze Jackie Robinson statue that was cut off at the ankles and found days later smoldering in a trash can has been sentenced to prison.

Ricky Alderete on Friday was sentenced to 18 months for the statue theft and also 13.5 years for an unrelated burglary. In a Kansas court, he said his actions stemmed from a fentanyl addiction.

The League 42 youth baseball league plans to unveil a replacement statue crafted from the original mold Monday at a park in Wichita. The city was shocked when the statue was cut from its base in January, leaving only the shoes and feet.

The league that primarily serves low-income youth is named after Robinson’s uniform number when he played for the Brooklyn Dodgers, with whom he broke the major leagues’ color barrier in 1947.

Firefighters found burned remnants of the statue five days later while responding to a trash can fire at another park about 7 miles away.

Alderete pleaded guilty to the theft. He was sentenced to 18 months and ordered to pay $41,500 restitution for stealing the statue.

He was also sentenced to 13.5 years in prison for an aggravated burglary that happened February 1.

“I let fentanyl take over me and made a lot of poor decisions. I am not going to deny that. I never meant to hurt anybody,” he said in court Friday. “I am embarrassed, I’m ashamed. Whatever you do today I accept.”

After the original statue was stolen, donations to replace it rolled in, including $100,000 from Major League Baseball. Former New York Yankees manager Joe Torre and 2007 American League Cy Young award winner CC Sabathia are expected to attend Monday’s unveiling.

The cleats left behind are now on display at the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum in Kansas City, Missouri.

Robinson played for the Kansas City Monarchs of the Negro Leagues before joining the Brooklyn Dodgers, paving the way for generations of Black American ballplayers. He is considered not only a sports legend but also a civil rights icon. Robinson died in 1972.
