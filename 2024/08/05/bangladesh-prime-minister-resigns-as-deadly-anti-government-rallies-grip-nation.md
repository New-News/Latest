The prime minister of Bangladesh, Sheikh Hasina resigned on Monday after weeks of deadly anti-government demonstrations gripped the South Asian nation.

The announcement from Army Chief Waker-uz-Zaman came after protesters stormed the official residence of the prime minister in the capital, Dhaka.

Images showed flames billowing from vehicles near Hasinaâ€™s house, with police unable to contain throngs of people charging towards the neighborhood.

Earlier in the day, the military and police had attacked demonstrators rallying in the area, according to a CNN fixer working in Dhaka.

At least 91 people have been killed in Bangladesh since mid-July, according to Reuters, during violent confrontations between police and protesters demanding the scrapping of quotas for government jobs.

This is a developing story and will be updated.
